# Create an Author class.
# An author can be initialized optionally with a name. If no name is provided, the author name should be "unkown"
# Every author that is created should be saved upon initialization.
# An Author has many articles that they've written.
# An author also has many magazines through articles.
# Create a .find_or_create_by_name method that acepts a name as an argument and returns an author object.
